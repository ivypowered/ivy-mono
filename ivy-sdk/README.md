# ivy-sdk

ivy-sdk is a TypeScript SDK built with Anchor that allows users to construct Solana transactions that interact with the Ivy smart contract.

## Notes

ivy-sdk was built for internal use, but it is our wish for it to be useful to external developers. If you are a developer using ivy-sdk and there is something missing that would help you in your development, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request and tell us how we can help you out. Thank you!
