# Welcome to Ivy

Web3 game development has always been difficult. Building blockchain-powered games requires writing smart contracts, dealing with complex SDKs, and managing wallet integrations. But, it doesn't have to be this way.

Ivy makes things easy. We provide a simple, language-agnostic REST API that handles all the blockchain complexity for you. You can build your game in any language, using any engine.

With Ivy, you can add Web3 features to your game and launch in hours, not months.

## How it Works

1. **Build your game** using any engine or programming language;
2. **Integrate Ivy's REST API** to enable blockchain features;
3. **Launch on the Ivy Marketplace** to instantly reach Ivy's community of Web3 players.

## Why Build on Ivy?

- **Simple:** Ivy's simple REST API abstracts away the blockchain, allowing you to get to market quickly.
- **Language-agnostic:** Ivy can be used from any language that can make HTTP requests; you don't have to worry about being locked into using a specific game engine or SDK.
- **Secure by design:** Ivy's standard on-chain components mean you don't have to roll your own smart contracts.
